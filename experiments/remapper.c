EXPERIMENT == 1
    In this case, it always creates a view for each individual write and each individual read.
    The results were attrocious, having the same performance (or worse?) than fread/fwrite.
    I didn't time it because it took like 10 minutes, while experiment 2 took like 5 seconds.

EXPERIMENT == 2
    In this case, the file view is kept around while the file mapping is valid. The file view
    is "lazy initialized". It FlushViewOfFile'es every 8MB to simulate "transactions". We could
    use this transaction approach in the main program since a transaction would be one command or so.
    This can be later tuned to hit the sweet spot. FlushViewOfFile (IFF I read the docs right)
    only writes dirty pages (where a page has an arbitrary OS specific size, i.e. with large memory
    chunks, it only writes the most recent additions). Allegedly, FlushViewOfFile does not
    update file metadata, which requires FlushFileBuffers on the file itself. FlushFileBuffers
    claims it's inefficient. I'm not sure what this "file metadata" actually is. As long as the
    data is recoverable, I don't care about metadata.

CRASH_AT_SOME_POINT == 1
    Cause an abort() crash to test if memory got committed. It seems it is.
